1. **Introduction to linked lists**: Definition and properties of linked lists, comparison to arrays.
    - _Dynamic data structures_: Linked lists are a type of dynamic data structure, meaning that they can grow or shrink in size during the execution of a program. This is in contrast to static data structures, such as arrays, which have a fixed size that cannot be changed once they are created. Linked lists are useful when the size of the data structure needs to be flexible, as they allow you to add or remove elements as needed.
    - _Efficient insertion and deletion_: Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as the operation can be performed in constant time (O(1)). This is in contrast to arrays, where insertion and deletion can be costly, as elements may need to be shifted to make room for the new element or to close the gap left by the deleted element.
    - _Memory efficiency_: Linked lists can be more memory-efficient than arrays, as they do not require a contiguous block of memory. In an array, the size of the block of memory must be large enough to accommodate the maximum number of elements that the array will hold. With a linked list, each element is stored in a separate node, which can be scattered throughout memory. This can be especially useful when the size of the data structure is not known in advance or when the data structure needs to be able to grow or shrink dynamically.
2. **Linked list operations**: Inserting and deleting nodes, traversing the list.
    - _Introduction to linked list operations_: Definition of common linked list operations, including inserting and deleting nodes, traversing the list.
    - _Inserting nodes_: Adding nodes to the front, middle, and end of a linked list.
    - _Deleting nodes_: Removing nodes from the front, middle, and end of a linked list.
    - _Traversing the list_: Iterating through the nodes of a linked list, accessing the data stored in each node.
    - _Searching the list_: Implementing a search algorithm to find a specific node in the linked list.
    - _Sorting the list_: Implementing different sorting algorithms using linked lists, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.
    - _Advanced linked list operations_: Reversing the list, finding the middle node, checking for loops.
3. Singly linked lists: Implementation and basic operations, including inserting and deleting nodes.
4. Doubly linked lists: Implementation and advanced operations, such as inserting and deleting nodes in constant time.
5. Circular linked lists: Definition and use cases, implementation of circular linked lists.
6. Linked list applications: Stack implementation using linked lists, merge sort using linked lists.
7. Advanced linked list topics: Memory management, sentinel nodes, lazy deletion.
8. **Interview questions and practice problems**: Common linked list questions asked in technical interviews, exercises to test understanding and improve problem-solving skills.
