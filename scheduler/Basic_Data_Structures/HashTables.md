1. **Introduction to hash tables**
    - Definition and basic concepts
    - Advantages and disadvantages compared to other data structures
    - Common operations (e.g. insertion, deletion, lookup)
2. **Hash functions**
    - Definition and basic concepts
    - Types of hash functions (e.g. modulo, multiplication, universal)
        * _Modulo hash function_: This type of hash function uses the modulo operator to map the keys to the indices of the hash table. The function takes the key as input, performs a modulo operation with the size of the hash table, and returns the remainder as the hash value. For example, if the size of the hash table is 10 and the key is 27, the hash value would be `27 % 10 = 7`. This hash function has the advantage of being simple to implement and fast to execute, but it can suffer from clustering, where a small number of indices get a disproportionately large number of keys.
        * _Multiplication hash function_: This type of hash function uses the fractional part of the product of the key and a constant as the hash value. The function takes the key as input, multiplies it by the constant (usually a fraction between 0 and 1), keeps the fractional part, and multiplies it by the size of the hash table to obtain the hash value. For example, if the size of the hash table is 10, the constant is 0.61803398875, and the key is 27, the hash value would be `(27 * 0.61803398875 - int(27 * 0.61803398875)) * 10 = 3.61803398875 * 10 = 6`. This hash function has the advantage of being relatively easy to implement and producing good results for a wide range of keys, but it can be slower than other hash functions due to the multiplication operation.
        * _Universal hash function_: This type of hash function is a family of hash functions that can be parameterized to produce different hash values for a given key. The function takes the key as input and a set of parameters, and applies a mathematical operation (e.g. modulo, multiplication, addition) to the key and the parameters to produce the hash value. Universal hash functions have the advantage of being able to produce a wide range of hash values with a low probability of collision, but they can be more complex to implement and slower to execute than other hash functions.
        ```python
        class UniversalHash:
            def __init__(self, size, max_val, slope, intercept):
                self.size = size
                self.max = max_val
                self.slope = slope
                self.intercept = intercept

            def hash(self, key):
                init = self.slope * key + self.intercept
                remainder = init % self.max_val
                hash_value = remainder % self.size
                return hash_value

        # Example usage
        hash_function = UniversalHash(size=10, max_val=11, slope=3, intercept=7)
        print(hash_function.hash(27))  # Output: 4
        print(hash_function.hash(41))  # Output: 6
        print(hash_function.hash(53))  # Output: 9
        ```
    - Choosing a good hash function
        * _Efficiency_: should be fast to compute and should not add significant overhead to the operations on the hash table.
        * _Distribution_: should distribute the keys uniformly across the indices of the hash table, to avoid clustering and maximize the utilization of the table.
        * _Unpredictability_: should not be predictable, to prevent malicious users from constructing keys that result in collisions or other attacks on the hash table.
        * _Robustness_: should be resistant to changes in the keys, such as leading zeros being added or removed, or case changes in strings.
        * _Simplicity_: should be simple to implement and understand, to reduce the risk of bugs and maintenance overhead.

    - Types of collision resolution strategies (e.g. chaining, open addressing)
    - Pros and cons of different strategies
4. **Hash table implementation**
    - Creating a hash table class in a programming language (e.g. Python)
    - Defining the structure of the hash table class
    - Implementing hash table operations as class methods
    ```python
    class HashTable:
        def __init__(self, size, p, a, b):
            self.size = size
            self.hash_function = UniversalHash(size, p, a, b)
            self.table = [[] for _ in range(size)]

        def insert(self, key, value):
            hash_value = self.hash_function.hash(key)
            self.table[hash_value].append((key, value))

        def search(self, key):
            hash_value = self.hash_function.hash(key)
            for k, v in self.table[hash_value]:
                if k == key:
                    return v
            return None

    # Example usage
    hash_table = HashTable(10, 11, 3, 7)
    hash_table.insert(27, "apple")
    hash_table.insert(41, "banana")
    hash_table.insert(53, "cherry")
    print(hash_table.search(27))  # Output: "apple"
    print(hash_table.search(41))  # Output: "banana"
    print(hash_table.search(53))  # Output: "cherry"
    ```
