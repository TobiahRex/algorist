## Data Flow & Transformation Concepts

Let me explain how cycle detection works across these different data structures:

### Common Terminology

- **Cycle**: A path in a graph or linked structure that starts and ends at the same node
- **Node/Vertex**: A data point in a graph or linked structure
- **Edge**: A connection between two nodes
- **Visited Set**: A collection tracking which nodes have been processed
- **Traversal**: The process of visiting all nodes in a structure
- **DFS**: Depth-First Search - explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking
- **BFS**: Breadth-First Search - explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving deeper

## Mental Model Breakdown by Commonality

### 1. Linked Lists Cycle Detection

The most common approaches, ordered by frequency of use:

1. **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Two-Pointer)**
   - **Data Flow**: Two pointers move through the list at different speeds
   - **Data Transformation**: If cycle exists, fast pointer eventually catches up to slow pointer
   - **Efficiency**: O(n) time with O(1) space - highly efficient

2. **Hash Set Tracking**
   - **Data Flow**: Traverse the list, tracking visited nodes in a set
   - **Data Transformation**: If we encounter a previously seen node, a cycle exists
   - **Efficiency**: O(n) time but requires O(n) space

### 2. Undirected Graphs Cycle Detection

1. **DFS with Parent Tracking**
   - **Data Flow**: Perform DFS traversal keeping track of parent for each node
   - **Data Transformation**: If we find an already visited node that's not the parent, cycle exists
   - **Efficiency**: O(V+E) time with O(V) space

2. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)**
   - **Data Flow**: Process edges one by one, joining connected components
   - **Data Transformation**: If an edge connects nodes already in the same set, cycle exists
   - **Efficiency**: O(E log V) time with O(V) space

3. **BFS Traversal**
   - **Data Flow**: Level by level traversal with parent tracking
   - **Data Transformation**: Similar logic to DFS - finding already visited non-parent node
   - **Efficiency**: O(V+E) time with O(V) space

### 3. Directed Graphs Cycle Detection

1. **DFS with Visit States**
   - **Data Flow**: DFS with nodes in one of three states: unvisited, in-progress, completed
   - **Data Transformation**: If we encounter an in-progress node, a cycle exists
   - **Efficiency**: O(V+E) time with O(V) space

2. **Topological Sort Based**
   - **Data Flow**: Attempt to create a valid topological ordering
   - **Data Transformation**: If impossible (due to back edge), a cycle exists
   - **Efficiency**: O(V+E) time with O(V) space

3. **Tarjan's Algorithm**
   - **Data Flow**: DFS with strongly connected component identification
   - **Data Transformation**: Any SCC with more than one node contains a cycle
   - **Efficiency**: O(V+E) time with O(V) space

Now, let's look at concrete code implementations for the most common patterns:

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the cycle detection implementations in more detail?
