This repo is dedicated to studying the concepts and algorithms that enable powerful expressivity as a Software Engineer. We strive to not focus on DSA as a method by which we get a job, or pass an exam. We instead strive to focus on DSA as a workshop where we explore the art of expressing our ideas across real-world use cases by leveraging the practicing of LeetCode problems. 


You'll find in this repo a lot of explanations, diagrams, questions and explorations. My overall goal was to personalize the experience with rich visualizations and mapping everything I learn to real-world use cases so that I can more easily pattern-match live on the job. 

To be honest, I've found great value in this approach. I retain more information for longer. I've actively recalled several situations where I could appply these techniques and patterns to real-world use cases. Overall this journey is about empowering us to believe we can build incredibly awesome products and systems by following the patterns.
