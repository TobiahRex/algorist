# Mindset

An exploration on how to _think_ when solving problems.

## Bulk-Apperception
Simultaneous lines of force is the principle concern when playing Chess. The person who can accurately understand simultaneous lines of force is playing the game in an ideal way. The ability to see how a change of one line of force impacts all others simultaneously is extremely valuable. In order to land at the point of mental clarity one needs several tools:

1. Mental visualization
2. Tactile Empathy
3. Base-reality disassociation
4. Expressivity of Truth 

## Mental visualization

- **Directionality**: Orient yours perspective to a particular direction (N, S, E, W).
- **Actors & Behavior**: Ideally by this point, we've drawn the entities to consider well-beforehand such that we're using the specific actor's in our mental model. The nuanced differences between Problem A and Problem B should be questioned from the perspective of "Is this problems unique trait a new actor? or a new behavior from what I've already known in the past?". 
  - Tree's can be thought of as decision trees, that best resemble a top-down understanding of the problem space. The structural differences in tree's have tremendous impact on the complexity of the different dimensions of expression. For example Block storage, File storage, and Object storage can be thought about as 3D blocks, A flat 2D tree, and a flat 2D Graph. Given the extra dimension of 3D blocks, it lend's itself intuitively to better performance, but at a much greater cost of both complexity and dollars. Block storage as a side effect of it's structure lends itself to hyper-organized data sets.

## Expressivity of Truth
Articulating what is seen. The ability to say what one see's and finds. Perhaps this need not be explicit but then again we often find ourselves struggling to articulate the technical parts of our understanding to another listener observing our process, so let's do so. 

Some mental framework for such a task may appear as:
1. Start with Structure
   1. Express the entities we should assign cognitive space to that will be the actors of our expression moving forward.
   2. These entities ideally have names, roles, particular functions or assignments that we should concern ourselves with.
   3. There's likely an order of choreography between these entities. They rarely all happen at the same time, some may happen in series, others in parallel/concurrently.
2. Embue with Behavior
   1. What side-effects do these entities create? Perhaps this is HOW to they effect the overall system.
   2. What expectations do these entities fullfill? IOW what jobs do they execute and WHY?
   3. How do they behave under non desireable circumstances?

## Base-reality disassociation
One need not be in touch with base reality when exploring the thought space of a problem. Necessarily, there's complete and total focus of the mental thoughtscape. Ideally one need not dissassociate, but rarely is the traversal between base reality and mental simulated reality an easy context switch. Hence why expressivity is important. That expressiveness acts as the telephone from a simulated reality to whoever is conversing with us in base reality. 

Here's some heuristic measures to use in order to validate whether one is usefully disassociated

*  Don't focus on the person, focus on what the person is saying
* Don't expect the first expression to be the last expression. One likely will need to iterate for the listener to feel satisfied. For that to be an orderly exercise, one could use a framework of execution. The following is my own, loosely asserted.

1. Ask the person - are you "bottom up" or "top down"?
2. Depending on their answer, you know from which direction to start expressing
3. The primary goal should be coverage (breadth), and less on specialty (depth). Unless there's time to discuss particulars but that's generally what
