    "1. **Eulerian Path**: _A path that starts at one node and ends at a different node, where all edges have been visited exactly once. Each Node has exactly an even number of edges. Or, there exists exactly 2 nodes with odd number of edges. If a graph has only even number of edges, then a more correct definition is to label the graph as having an **Eulerian Cycle** (also \"Circuit\"). An \"Eulerian Path\" is a superset of an \"Eulerian Cycle\"._\n",
    "2. **Eulerian Cycle/Circuit**: _A path that starts at one node and ends at the **same** node. Every node in the graph has an even number of edges, with no node having an odd number of edges. Also, all the edges in the graph are in a single connected component. An \"Eulerian Cycle\" is a sub-set of an \"Eulerian Path_\n",
