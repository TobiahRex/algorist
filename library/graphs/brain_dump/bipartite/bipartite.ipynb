    "# Bi-Partite Graph\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## What\n",
    "\n",
    "- A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be split into two independent groups, G1, G2 so that every resulting edge connects between G1 and G2.\n",
    "- Said another way, no Vertice will be adjacent to a vertice in it's own group, this is known as a _two colorable_ graph.\n",
    "- This property also defines the phenomenon effect of a graph having no cycle with an odd length number of edges, but rather a cycle could exist with an even number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why are they useful? Mostly having to do with matching groups together.\n",
    "- The best mental model is **_Supply_ & _Demand_** scenarios.\n",
    "- Say customers want to check out a book from a library, but there's a finite number of books available.\n",
    "- A bi-partite representation of the problem where customers will be G1 and books will be G2 can provide a state machine to manage such scenarios.\n",
    "- There's also _**flow-state**_ problems, where we want to determine the flow rate thru a graph. There's also _**Travel to Sink**_ where we want to determine the best route from one _source_ Vertice in the graph and travel to the nearest _sink_ Vertice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum Cardinality Matching\n",
    "- Sink Nodes\n",
    "- Two Colorable Vertices\n",
    "- Augmented Paths\n",
    "- Hopcroft-Karp\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coloring Property**: A graph is bipartite if and only if it is 2-colorable. This means that we can assign one of two colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n",
    "- **Cycle Property**: A graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain any odd-length cycles.\n",
    "- **Complete Bipartite Graph**: A bipartite graph is complete if every vertex of the first part is connected to every vertex of the second part.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Job Allocation**: Consider a scenario where there are `n` jobs and `m` workers. A bipartite graph can represent which worker is eligible for which job.\n",
    "2. **Marriage Problem**: Known as the Stable Marriage problem. Given `n` men and `n` women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite set in order of preference, marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners.\n",
    "3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Used in recommendation systems. For example, users and their purchased items can be represented as a bipartite graph, and it can help in recommending items to users.\n",
    "4. **Flow Networks**: A flow network is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. A flow must satisfy the restriction that the amount of flow into a vertex equals the amount of flow out of it, except when it is a source, which \"produces\" flow, or sink, which \"consumes\" flow.\n",
    "5. **Data Mining**: Bipartite graphs can be used to represent different types of relationships between two different classes of objects. For example, in a graph of co-authorship between authors and papers, the authors are one class of objects and the papers are the other class of objects. The bipartite graph can be projected into a graph of authors, where two authors are connected if they have co-authored a paper together. This graph of authors is called a _projection_ of the bipartite graph of authors and papers.\n",
    "6. **Social Networks**: Bipartite graphs can be used to represent relationships between two different classes of objects. For example, in a graph of followers between users and pages, the users are one class of objects and the pages are the other class of objects. The bipartite graph can be projected into a graph of users, where two users are connected if they follow the same page. This graph of users is called a _projection_ of the bipartite graph of users and pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bipartite Graph Check**: Using BFS or DFS, we can color the graph and determine if it's bipartite.\n",
    "- **Maximum Flow**: The _Ford-Fulkerson algorithm_ can be applied to find the maximum flow in a flow network which can be represented as a bipartite graph. Useful for...\n",
    "  - Job allocation\n",
    "  - marriage problem,\n",
    "  - collaborative filtering,\n",
    "  - data mining, and\n",
    "  - social networks.\n",
    "- **Bipartite Matching**: The _Hungarian algorithm_ and _Hopcroft-Karp_ algorithm can find the maximum matching in bipartite graphs.\n",
    "  - Job allocation\n",
    "  - marriage problem,\n",

    "\n",
    "## More Jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hall's Marriage Theorem**: Provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a matching that covers every vertex in one of the bipartite sets.\n",
    "- **Perfect Matching**: A matching that covers every vertex of the graph. Not all bipartite graphs have perfect matchings.\n",
    "- **Independent Set**: A set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. In a bipartite graph, at least one of its parts is an independent set.\n",
    "- **Cover**: A set of vertices such that every edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set. In bipartite graphs, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching (KÃ¶nig's theorem).\n",
    "- **Alternating Path**: A path that begins with an unmatched vertex and alternates between edges not in the matching and edges in the matching.\n",
    "- **Residual Graph**: In the context of flows and matchings, it represents how much capacity is left on each edge after sending flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deciding if a general graph is bipartite is easy, but determining the maximum cardinality bipartite matching or minimum vertex cover in bipartite graphs can be more challenging and requires specialized algorithms.\n",
    "- In real-world scenarios, data might not always neatly fit into bipartite structures, and approximations or heuristic methods might be needed.\n"
