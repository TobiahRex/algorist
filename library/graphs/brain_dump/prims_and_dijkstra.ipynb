    "# Prim's and Dijkstra's Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Prim's algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm are both used to solve graph-related problems, but they serve different purposes and are designed for different types of graph problems. Here are the key differences between Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Prim's algorithm is primarily used for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, connected graph. The MST is a subgraph that includes all vertices of the original graph with the minimum possible total edge weight, without forming any cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Dijkstra's algorithm is used for finding the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It is commonly used in network routing, navigation systems, and optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Problem Type**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Prim's algorithm is focused on solving the MST problem. It selects edges that connect vertices in such a way that the resulting subgraph is a tree and the total edge weight is minimized. It considers all nodes in the graph and does not focus on a single source node like Dijkstra's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph. It does not necessarily result in a tree, and it focuses on finding the shortest distances or costs from the source vertex to all other vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Structures**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Prim's algorithm typically uses a priority queue or a min-heap data structure to efficiently select the next edge with the smallest weight to add to the MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Dijkstra's algorithm also uses a priority queue or a min-heap to select the next vertex to visit based on the shortest known distance from the source vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Termination Conditions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Prim's algorithm terminates when all vertices are included in the MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Dijkstra's algorithm terminates when the shortest path to all vertices from the source vertex has been determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Edge Weights**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Prim's algorithm assumes that all edge weights are non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Dijkstra's algorithm works correctly with non-negative edge weights and can handle graphs with negative edge weights if certain modifications are made (e.g., using the Bellman-Ford algorithm for negative weight cycles).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Prim's algorithm is used for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph, while Dijkstra's algorithm is used for finding the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph. Both algorithms are essential tools in graph theory and have specific applications based on the problem at hand.\n",

    "```shell\n",
    "PRIM-MST(graph):\n",
    "    1. Start with an arbitrary vertex as the initial MST.\n",
    "    2. Create a priority queue or min-heap and push all the edges from this vertex to the queue.\n",
    "    3. While the queue is not empty and MST is not yet complete:\n",
    "        a) Get the edge with the smallest weight (top of the priority queue).\n",
    "        b) Check if adding this edge creates a cycle with the MST so far.\n",
    "        c) If no cycle, add this edge to the MST.\n",
    "        d) Push all the edges from the newly added vertex to the queue.\n",
    "    4. When all vertices are included in the MST or the priority queue is empty, return the MST.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Intuitively, Prim's algorithm grows the MST one vertex at a time. It starts with an arbitrary vertex and then repeatedly adds the smallest edge that connects any vertex in the MST so far to a vertex outside of it. This is effectively a greedy algorithm that always chooses the locally optimal edge with the smallest weight. The priority queue is used to efficiently select the next edge to add to the MST.\n"
