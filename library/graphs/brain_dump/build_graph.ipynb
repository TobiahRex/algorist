    "- Given the total number of nodes and an edge list, this technique is quite fast.\n",
    "- NOTE: We're potentially adding more key's than are necessary to the map, since not every node may have an out-degree edge. Although this will safe conditional logic later to check if a node is in the adjacency map, and if it is, then iterate over it's neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "1. Space efficient\n",
    "2. Good for simply getting the neighbors of a node\n",
    "3. Easy to implement\n",
    "4. If edges have weights, then we could modify the list values to be tuples `[(value, edge-weight), (value, edge-weight), ...]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "1. If we're mutating the graph by deleting edges, then it takes O(m) time to remove the edge. This can be optimized however if we store neighbors as a set rather than a list."
