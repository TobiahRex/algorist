    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "1. Understand what **tools** are available when dealing with D-Graph's.\n",
    "2. Understanding the differences's of D-Graphs's compared to Undirected Graphs (U-Graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "1. **_DFS_**: Most often used when dealing with Directed Graphs because the directed nature of the graph automatically implies only a specific path is available.\n",
    "2. **_Dijkstra_**: Any graph type. _Linear Time_ traversal which finds single-source shortest path.\n",
    "3. **_Bellman-Ford_**: It's purpose is to handle negative edge weights in _Quadratic Time_.\n",
    "4. **_Floyd-Warshall_**: It's purpose \n",
    "5. **_Topological Sort_**: Sorts the verticies such that the weight/cost to reach a vertex is sorted. Also helps show the dependency-nature of a graph.\n",
    "    1. _Pre & Post Visit Accounting_: Allows us to easily detect **Back-Edge**, **Cross-Edge** and **Forward-Edge**.\n",
    "    2. _Kahn's Algorithm_: Gathers the Degree of each node, iteratively deleting the nodes with the fewest in-degree and their respective edges, adding each one to the final sorted list as deletion progresses.\n",

    "## Differences: Undirected & Directed Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. UGs are less opinionated about how answers to questions can be found. UG's are very useful for broadly describing a problem, location, a set of choices, and finding answers to to broad questions.In contrast, DG's are very opinionated, and very tempermental, and due to this strictness, can answer very specific questions about very sensetive data-sets.  DG's are meant to describe dependency relationships. Typically it's important for DG's not to contain cycles, since a philosophically betrays the idea that some event must happen before some other event. A cycle, philosophically, means that there's a built-in shortcut to that dependency paradigm which makes the answer to some dependency-bounded question, undeterministic and therefore unuseful.  SO, a big part of DG's is to find cycles. To find cycles, we typically are also simultaneously finding a topological mapping of the DG, so those two processes are often done at the same time; Cycle-Detection & Topological-Sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UG's are friendly to BFS, and BFS shines brightly on UG graphs. Especially when wanting to find the shortest/longest/max/min/best/worst (some qualitative constraint) answer to some question. DFS cannot always guarantee that it will deterministically locate the answer to such questions.  So, UG's are used in cases where there are no dependencies between a collection of choices, but an optimized sequence of choices is desired.  DG's are used when there is a dependency from one choice to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tree graphs are a subset of the graph family. Further, Tree graphs, are UG's that have no cycles.  Typically Tree Graphs are used in order to optimize the time required to answer many questions about some topic. The nature of the tree, has an implied removal of bad choices (not traversing some branch in the tree because it doesn't meet some criteria) while finding the good choices in the quickest possible runtime _logarithmic_. The number of branches at each level will determine the base of that log.  However, it's useful to think of DG's as Tree's as well, even tho it's not the first intuitive mental-model. The benefit of using a Tree-Model is because the representational contract of a DG as a Tree is *extremely* strict. If the DG behavior is wrong, it will be easy to detect. The main tool for detecting behavior of a DG in a Tree-like model is the idea of *Pre/Post Visit Accounting*.\n",

    "We simply track the time we arrived (*Pre-Visit*) at some node in the tree as we traverse downward, and then when we arrive at the leaf level and start to move back upward, we log the departure time (*Post-Visit*) at every node.  We can determine what kind of ancestral relationship exists between any node and all of it's edges using this accounting notation. Using only this information we can define the following 3 important concepts:\n",
    "* **Forward-Edge**: From _u_ to _v_ that is a non-child desendent DFS tree. Node _v_ should also already have been visited (has a departure time).\n",
    "* **Back-Edge**: From _v_ to _u_ that is a non-child descendent in the DFS tree. **CYCLE: Graph contains a cycle**. Node _v_ points to it's ancestor where the ancestor has been visited, but has no departure time.\n",
    "* **Cross-Edge**: From _u_ to _v_ where _v_ is *not* a desendent nor ancestor. Node _v_ has been visited, and node _v_'s arrival was sooner than node _u_ which means that node _v_ is a sibling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE:* We can use this Pre/Post visit strategy on UG graphs as well.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Connectivity** is also an importnat difference. In UG's we are liberally accepting of a Graph that has many disconnected components and we account for them quite easily with an outer loop that iterates through every Vertex.  However in DG's we're much more strict. We don't consider multiple components as part of the same graph. We only consider a *single-component*.  However, that being said _every DG is a DAG of it's **Strongly Connected Components**_.\n",

    "There are 5 _strongly connected components_ in the image above.  This image shines a lot of powerful intuition onto DG's and how deeply examine them and mine them for informative answers to specific questions.
