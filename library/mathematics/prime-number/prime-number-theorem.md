# The Prime Number Theorem
A fundamental result in number theory that describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers. It provides insights into how prime numbers become less frequent as we examine larger and larger numbers. Here's an explanation of the Prime Number Theorem:

**Prime Number Theorem Explanation:**

The Prime Number Theorem, formulated independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin in the late 19th century, states that as you examine increasingly larger numbers, the density of prime numbers relative to all natural numbers decreases.

More formally, the theorem describes the asymptotic behavior of the prime-counting function π(n), which counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given positive integer n. The Prime Number Theorem provides an approximation for π(n) as n grows larger:

π(n) is approximately equal to n / ln(n).

Here's what this means:

1. As n becomes larger and larger, the ratio of π(n) to n/ln(n) approaches 1, indicating that the prime-counting function π(n) is asymptotically proportional to n/ln(n).

2. The Prime Number Theorem tells us that the density of prime numbers among natural numbers (i.e., the proportion of numbers that are prime) decreases as we move to larger values of n. This means that prime numbers become increasingly sparse as we examine higher numbers.

**Example:**

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose we want to count the prime numbers up to 100:

- π(100) is the actual count of prime numbers up to 100, which is 25.
- The Prime Number Theorem's approximation suggests that π(100) is approximately equal to 100 / ln(100), which is approximately 21.7.

Notice that the actual count (25) is slightly higher than the approximation (21.7), but as we examine larger and larger values of n, the approximation becomes increasingly accurate. For extremely large values of n, the density of prime numbers approaches 1/ln(n), indicating that prime numbers become rarer in comparison to all natural numbers.

In summary, the Prime Number Theorem is a key result in number theory that reveals how prime numbers are distributed among natural numbers. It shows that the density of prime numbers decreases as we move to larger numbers, and it provides an essential understanding of the distribution of primes in the realm of mathematics.
