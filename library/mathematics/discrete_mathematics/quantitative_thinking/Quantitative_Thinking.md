# Discrete Mathematics

## 4. Quantitative Thinking
- Definition: Quantitative thinking involves dealing with quantities, numbers, and mathematical operations.
- Example: Software engineers use quantitative thinking when optimizing code for performance. For instance, when designing an algorithm, you might analyze its time complexity (Big O notation) to understand how its runtime scales with input size.
