# 1.1 Proposition

**Formal Logic: Propositions**

In the world of Discrete Mathematics, Formal Logic serves as the bedrock upon which much of the subject stands. Formal Logic helps us reason rigorously and precisely about propositions, which are statements that can be either true or false. In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of propositions and their logical operations.

### What is a Proposition?

A proposition is a statement that has a definite truth value – it's either true or false, but not both. Consider the following examples:

1. "The sky is blue." - This is a proposition, and its truth value depends on the current weather conditions.
2. "2 + 2 = 5." - This is also a proposition, and it's clearly false.

Not all sentences are propositions. Questions like "How are you?" are not propositions because they don't have a clear truth value; they depend on the context and the person's feelings.

### Logical Operators

#### Negation (¬)

The negation of a proposition reverses its truth value. If P is a proposition, then ¬P is the negation of P. For example:

- P: "The cat is on the mat."
- ¬P: "The cat is not on the mat."

#### Conjunction (AND - ∧)

The conjunction of two propositions, P and Q, denoted as P ∧ Q, is true only when both P and Q are true. Consider this example:

- P: "The sun is shining."
- Q: "The sky is clear."
- P ∧ Q: "The sun is shining, and the sky is clear."

P ∧ Q is true only if both P and Q are true.

#### Disjunction (OR - ∨)

The disjunction of two propositions, P and Q, denoted as P ∨ Q, is true if at least one of them is true. Consider this example:

- P: "It's Monday."
- Q: "It's raining."
- P ∨ Q: "It's Monday, or it's raining (or both)."

P ∨ Q is true if either P or Q (or both) is true.

#### Implication (IF...THEN - ⇒)

The implication between two propositions, P (the antecedent) and Q (the consequent), denoted as P ⇒ Q, is true unless P is true and Q is false. Consider this example:

- P: "If it's raining."
- Q: "I'll bring an umbrella."
- P ⇒ Q: "If it's raining, then I'll bring an umbrella."

P ⇒ Q is true unless it's raining (P is true) and you don't bring an umbrella (Q is false).

#### Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF - ⇔)

The biconditional between two propositions, P and Q, denoted as P ⇔ Q, is true when P and Q have the same truth value. Consider this example:

- P: "The light is on."
- Q: "The room is illuminated."
- P ⇔ Q: "The light is on if and only if the room is illuminated."

P ⇔ Q is true if both P and Q have the same truth value.

### 1.3 Truth Tables

Truth tables are powerful tools for analyzing propositions and their logical operations. They systematically list all possible combinations of truth values for the component propositions and show the resulting truth value for the compound proposition. Here's a truth table for the conjunction (AND) operation:

| P   | Q   | P ∧ Q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| T   | T   |   T   |
| T   | F   |   F   |
| F   | T   |   F   |
| F   | F   |   F   |

This truth table shows that P ∧ Q is true only when both P and Q are true. Similar truth tables can be constructed for the other logical operators.

Certainly! Here are some truth tables for propositions involving disjunctions (∨), implications (⇒), and biconditionals (⇔) using multiple symbols:

#### Disjunction (OR - ∨) Truth Table:

| P   | Q   | P ∨ Q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| T   | T   |   T   |
| T   | F   |   T   |
| F   | T   |   T   |
| F   | F   |   F   |

In this truth table, P ∨ Q is true if at least one of P or Q is true.

#### Implication (IF...THEN - ⇒) Truth Table:

| P   | Q   | P ⇒ Q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| T   | T   |   T   |
| T   | F   |   F   |
| F   | T   |   T   |
| F   | F   |   T   |

Here, P ⇒ Q is true unless P is true and Q is false. This captures the idea of "if P, then Q."

#### Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF - ⇔) Truth Table: 2-way dependency

| P   | Q   | P ⇔ Q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| T   | T   |   T   |
| T   | F   |   F   |
| F   | T   |   F   |
| F   | F   |   T   |

In this truth table, P ⇔ Q is true only when P and Q have the same truth value. It expresses "P if and only if Q."

These truth tables provide a clear representation of how these logical operations work and help in analyzing the truth values of compound propositions in various scenarios.

### BiConditional vs Non-BiConditional
Here are some sentence examples of biconditionals (expressed as "if and only if" or "is equivalent to"):

1. **Mathematics:** "A triangle is equilateral if and only if all its sides are of equal length." (In this case, being an equilateral triangle is equivalent to having all sides of equal length.)

2. **Programming:** "The user can access the admin panel if and only if they are logged in as an administrator." (Access to the admin panel is conditional on both being logged in and having administrator privileges.)

3. **Physics:** "An object will float in water if and only if its density is less than the density of water." (Buoyancy depends on the relationship between the object's density and the density of the surrounding fluid.)

4. **Philosophy:** "A statement is considered a tautology if and only if it is true for all possible truth values of its variables." (Tautology in propositional logic is defined as a statement that is true under all interpretations of its variables.)

5. **Education:** "A student will graduate with honors if and only if they maintain a high GPA throughout their academic career." (Graduating with honors depends on consistently maintaining a high GPA.)

6. **Economics:** "The market will reach equilibrium if and only if the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied." (Market equilibrium occurs when supply equals demand, and this relationship is bidirectional.)

7. **Chess:** "A pawn can be promoted to a queen if and only if it reaches the opponent's back rank." (Promotion to a queen is the sole outcome of reaching the back rank, and reaching the back rank implies promotion to a queen.)

8. **Web Development:** "The website will display correctly if and only if the HTML and CSS are properly coded." (The correct display of a website is contingent on both the HTML and CSS being correctly written.)

In each of these examples, the biconditional (if and only if) is used to express a relationship where two conditions or events are **_interdependent_**, and one implies the other.

#### Here are some sentences that are NOT biconditional

1. **Mathematics:** "A square has four equal sides." (This sentence states a fact about squares but does not establish a two-way relationship.)

2. **Programming:** "If the user enters the correct password, they can access the system." (This is a conditional statement, but it does not state a two-way relationship; it only specifies a condition for access.)

3. **Physics:** "When an object is dropped, it falls toward the ground." (This describes a cause-and-effect relationship but does not express a mutual dependency.)

4. **Philosophy:** "Moral values vary from culture to culture." (This statement discusses the variability of moral values but does not establish a direct equivalence.)

5. **Education:** "To graduate, students must complete all required courses." (This is a requirement for graduation but does not imply a bidirectional relationship.)

6. **Economics:** "Increasing interest rates can lead to lower consumer spending." (This statement describes an effect of interest rates but does not state a mutual condition.)

7. **Chess:** "Moving a knight in an L-shape is a valid chess move." (This describes a valid chess move but does not establish a two-way equivalence.)

8. **Web Development:** "A well-designed website improves user experience." (This states the benefit of a well-designed website but does not express a two-way relationship.)

These sentences provide information, describe relationships, or set conditions, but they do not express the specific bidirectional relationship characteristic of biconditional statements.

### Conclusion

Understanding propositions and their logical operations is fundamental to discrete mathematics and computer science. These concepts form the basis for more complex logical structures and are essential in areas such as programming, artificial intelligence, and formal verification. In the subsequent chapters, we will delve deeper into propositional logic and explore its applications in solving real-world problems.
