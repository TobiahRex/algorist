   - GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) calculations.
   - Prime number-related problems.
   - Modular arithmetic, which is crucial in cryptography.

2. **Probability and Statistics:**
   - Questions involving probability distributions and expected values.
   - Statistical analysis of data, especially when dealing with financial data in DeFi.

3. **Combinatorics:**
   - Problems involving permutations and combinations, which can relate to token arrangements and permutations of cryptographic keys.

4. **Linear Algebra:**
   - Matrix operations and transformations, which may be relevant in certain blockchain applications.

5. **Geometry:**
   - Geometric algorithms for spatial data, if applicable to the specific role.

6. **Optimization:**
   - Optimization problems related to portfolio management, liquidity provision, or yield farming strategies in DeFi.

7. **Graph Theory:**
   - Graph algorithms can be used in various aspects of blockchain, such as finding the shortest path in payment networks or analyzing transaction graphs.

8. **Number Representation:**
   - Understanding how numbers are represented in binary and hexadecimal, which is foundational in blockchain and cryptography.

9. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms, which is fundamental to evaluate the performance of DeFi systems.
