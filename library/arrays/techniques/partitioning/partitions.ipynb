    "1. Step 1:\n",
    "    - Pick a random Pivot. Why? Because this will avoid the _worst case scenario_ (see details at end of section).\n",
    "    - ```python\n",
    "        rix = random.randint(0, len(a)-1)\n",
    "        pivot = a[rix]\n",
    "        swap(a, rix, high)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Step 2:\n",
    "    - Define a sliding window\n",
    "    - ```python\n",
    "        i = low\n",
    "        for j in range(low, high):\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - `i` points to the **lowest** index where we can swap to. All elements left of `i` will be less than the pivot value. It will only *manually increment*.\n",
    "    - `j` points to the n'th value to compare, during one of the repeated passes. It will *automatically increment*.\n",
    "3. Step 3:\n",
    "    - Evaluate the n'th value relative to the pivot value\n",
    "    - ```python\n",
    "        if a[j] <= pivot:\n",
    "            if j > i:\n",
    "                swap(a, j, i)\n",
    "            i += 1\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - <img src=\"https://imgur.com/IKGmgin.png\" style=\"max-width:500px\">\n",
    "    - In the image above `i` = **lower pointer**, and `j` = **upper pointer**\n",
    "    - <img src=\"https://imgur.com/vw4r16B.png\" style=\"max-width:500px\">\n",
    "    - The pivot is `8`. The image shows the transition between, having finished evaluating `4` to `8`.  Since `4` is less than `8`, we increment `i`. The for loop, automatically will push `j` forward. And we'll see that since `9` is gte `8`, `i` will **not** move forward.\n",
    "    - <img src=\"https://imgur.com/uIwpXqP.png\" style=\"max-width:500px\">\n",
    "    - Now since `1` is lt `8`, we'll **swap** 1 with `9`. The result will be that `1` will be to the left of `9`, fullfilling the contract of the partition algo\n",
    "    > After iterating, all values left of the pivot, will be less than the pivot.\n",
    "    - <img src=\"https://imgur.com/ckgxRF3.png\" style=\"max-width:500px\">\n",
    "    - As we can see, `1` has been swapped to the left of `9`, and `j` is now pointing to `7` which will also be swapped with `9` since it's also lt `lt` the pivot.\n",
    "4. Step 4:\n",
    "    - Put the pivot value in it's final resting place, and return the index of the pivot.\n",
    "    - ```python\n",
    "        swap(a, high, i)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - `i` has been tracking the left-most index where the pivot will be greater than all elements to the left, so once we've looked at all values, we can be sure, `i` is the best/last place to put the `pivot` value. The pivot has been sitting at `a[high]` so it's out of the way while we evaluate where to put it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Ideas\n",
    "1. Pick a random index, and put that index to the far-right (out of the way)\n",
    "2. `i` is finding the correct spot for the pivot.\n",
    "3. `j` is looking at the `n'th` value in the current  array iteration.\n",
    "4. All values between `i` & `j` are greater than the pivot."
