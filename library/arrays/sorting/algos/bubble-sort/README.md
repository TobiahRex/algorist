# Bubble Sort
## Plane Boarding
Imagine you have a long line of people waiting to board an international flight, and each person is holding a boarding pass with a number on it. The goal is to arrange these people in ascending order based on their boarding pass numbers using a simple sorting method called "Bubble Sort."

Here's how the mental model of Bubble Sort works in this scenario:

1. **Comparing Adjacent Passengers:** You start at one end of the line and look at the first person's boarding pass number. Then, you move to the next person in line and compare their number to the first person's number.

2. **Bubble Up:** If the second person's number is smaller than the first person's number, you swap their positions. This action is like a "bubble" because the smaller person moves up in the line.

3. **Repeat the Process:** You continue moving down the line, comparing and swapping adjacent passengers as needed. The goal is to keep "bubbling" the smaller passengers upward until the person with the smallest boarding pass number ends up at the front of the line.

4. **Iterate:** You keep repeating this process for multiple passes along the line, just like how bubbles rise to the surface in water. After each pass, the person with the largest boarding pass number "bubbles" to the end of the line.

5. **Completion:** Eventually, after several passes, the entire line will be sorted, with the passengers holding the smallest boarding pass numbers at the front and those with the largest numbers at the back.

In this mental model, you can visualize the process of Bubble Sort as passengers "bubbling" up or down the line until they are in the correct order, much like bubbles rising in a liquid. It's a straightforward and intuitive way to understand how Bubble Sort works, even though it may not be the most efficient sorting method for large datasets.
