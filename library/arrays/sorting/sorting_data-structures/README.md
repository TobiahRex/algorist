# Sorting Data-Structures
Sorting problems often involve various data structures and algorithms to efficiently arrange elements in a specific order. Here are some commonly used data structures in sorting problems:

1. **Arrays/Lists**: Arrays or lists are often used for in-place sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and quicksort. They are the most basic data structure for sorting.

2. **Linked Lists**: Linked lists can be advantageous for certain sorting algorithms, especially when it comes to insertion sort, which can perform well when elements are inserted into a sorted linked list.
    * Insertion Sort
    * Skip Lists

3. **Heaps**: As you mentioned, heaps are commonly used in algorithms like heap sort and priority queues. They are efficient for maintaining the maximum or minimum value in a dataset and for algorithms requiring the top or bottom k elements.
    * Top/Bottom K Elements

4. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: BSTs like AVL trees and Red-Black trees can be used for sorting data while maintaining a sorted order. In-order traversal of a BST provides sorted elements.
    * In-Order Traversal

5. **Merge Sort**: Merge sort often uses extra data structures like arrays or lists to divide and merge data recursively. These temporary structures facilitate the divide-and-conquer approach.
    * Divide & Conquer

6. **Hash Tables**: Hash tables are not used for sorting directly but can be used for certain sorting-related tasks like counting sort and radix sort, where keys are hashed for faster access.
    * Counting Sort
    * Radix Sort

7. **Skip Lists**: Skip lists are an alternative to balanced trees and can be used for sorting and searching operations. They provide O(log n) average time complexity for search and insert operations.
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Skip Lists

8. **Bucket Sort**: Bucket sort uses an array of buckets to distribute elements into smaller subsets before sorting each subset. It is particularly useful for sorting elements with known distributions.

9. **Priority Queues**: Priority queues, often implemented with heaps, are used for sorting by selecting and removing the highest-priority element iteratively.
    * Heap Sort
    * Top/Bottom K Elements

10. **Trie**: Tries are used for sorting and searching for strings or sequences. They are particularly efficient for string sorting problems.
    * Radix Sort

11. **Graph-Based Algorithms**: Algorithms like topological sort use graphs to sort elements based on dependencies or relationships.
    * Topological Sort

12. **Self-Balancing Trees**: Self-balancing binary search trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees can be used to maintain a sorted order efficiently.
    * In-Order Traversal

13. **Counting Arrays**: Counting sort uses an auxiliary array to count the occurrences of each element, making it suitable for sorting integers with a limited range.
    * Counting Sort

These data structures can be combined with various sorting algorithms and techniques to tackle sorting problems efficiently depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.
