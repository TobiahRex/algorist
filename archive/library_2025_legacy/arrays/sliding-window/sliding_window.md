I love this feedback. Let me build the enhanced version with problem descriptions and problem-specific code examples.[**View Sliding Window Deep Dive v2**](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/sliding-window-v2.html)

---

## What's New in v2

### 1. **Problem Descriptions with Examples**
Each classic problem now shows:
- The actual problem statement (how LeetCode words it)
- Input/Output example
- Click any problem card to load its code

### 2. **Problem-Specific Code**
The code section now has a dropdown with 7 options:
- 🔷 **Universal Pattern** — the generic template
- **6 specific problems** — each with bespoke implementations

### 3. **Three Tabs Per Problem**
For each problem you select:

| Tab          | What It Shows                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Verbose**  | Class-based, every concept named explicitly   |
| **Terse**    | Interview-ready compressed version            |
| **Template** | How the 3 blanks map to this specific problem |

### 4. **Click-to-Select Sync**
- Click a problem card → code updates
- Change dropdown → card highlights
- Everything stays in sync

Try clicking through the problems and watch how the code transforms. The Template tab is especially useful — it shows exactly which blanks get filled in for each problem type.

Ready for the next pattern when you are!
