    "  1. Annoying edge case, to ensure work is worth being done otherwise quit early.\n",
    "  2. We save the distance travelled so far for a given Q'd node. If the problem was asking us to return the actual path travelled, this second argument would be a list of node values indicating the \"bread-crumb\" trail we took.\n",
    "  3. This logic could be done in a lot of places. However, i felt that it was most deterministically accurate to check directly after popping from the Q. This is akin to a recursive base-case check. As soon as we prepare to do some work, we first check if we've found the solution, otherwise, we continue.\n",
    "  4. This is **the major takeaway** from this problem; Typically we generate a graph by calculating it's edges **before** we start a traversal. However in this problem, we're calculating the next set of edges **on-the-fly**. I believe this technique is why this problem is considered `HARD` rather than `MEDIUM`.\n",
    "  5. As for HOW we're going about calculating the neighbors, this is quite interesting. Because we know we're looking for exactly a difference of 1 between word_1 and word_2, we know that the difference must exist within the actual alphabet. Meaning there's only 26 possible differences between two valid words having an edge between them. Therefore, we simply brute-force our way thru this list and generate every possible edge theoretically possible and validate the possibility against the given list of words. This is Asymptotically cheaper than looking thru every word, and comparing to every other word, every time we need to check for generate a neighbors list.\n",
    "  6. If however the word list is shorter than 26, then it's cheaper to look thru every word.\n",
    "  7. This is another key technqiue in this problem: we're _defining an edge by detecting an impossible edge_. If the difference in letter is greater than 1, the edge is impossible.\n"

To determine what character is next in the sequence, we take the previous character's index from the stack pop, and simply increment by 1 to find the next target character. If that target character, matches the neighbor character, then we append to the stack.\n",

If DFS backtracking is what we need, then it's deterministically easier to simply build a recursive DFS with backtracking. When we want to backtrack, we simply pop off from the visited set, the faulty node we tried to go. The \"state\" of neighbors is saved in the call stack, so we can continue iterating from where we were one level up in the call stack.\n"
