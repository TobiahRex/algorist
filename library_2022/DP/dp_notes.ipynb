    "1. _Optimal Substructure_: **Required** for DP solution. Can be defined by 1 or more of the following\n",
    "    * The problem can be solved using subproblems.\n",
    "    * The problem asks explicitly for _Max/Min_, _Largest/Smallest_, or some other comparitive adjective to express an upper & lower bound.\n",
    "2. _Overlapping Subproblems_: **NOT** Required for DP solution.\n",
    "    * Overlapping subproblems is not a pre-req for DP. After all if the problem cannot benefit from memoization, then memoization will help with nothing.\n",
    "    * Example of this scenarios is: Find the largest/smallest subset of elements that sum to a given number. In this problem we have two variables that change at each recursive call such that they never give the same inputs to any other recursive call.  However, this problem does utilize an _inclusion/exclusion paradigm_ and therefore makes 2D tab.DP a perfect candidate to problem solve in Quadratic time.\n",
    "    * When there does exist overlapping sub-problems then tab.DP is definitely the best solution since Call-Stack latency is not a factor.\n",

    "5. The Recurrence Relation (RR) can be used to find the base-cases.\n",
    "6. Recursion helps answer questions with multiple answers. Multiple answers = multiple sub-problems.\n",
    "7. To find overlapping subproblems, ask: _\"Can i find the same answer with different choices?\"_\n",
    "8. DP isn't concerned with DOING the actual work of the problem. It's concerned with **COUNTING** the # of steps to do the work.\n"

    "## Tabulation\n",
    "### Easy & Medium\n",
    "1. The Table saves answers to each subproblem.\n",
    "    - 1-dimensional tab.DP contains a large non-deterministic set of use cases. Typically however, the pattern is that we're _counting_ up some sub-problem answers. We could also be pushing values forward in a look-ahead manner, and other techniques. The point here is that 1D is deterministically different from 2D for one specific reason...\n",
    "    - 2D is principally useful within _inclusion/exclusion paradigm_.  The entire point of 2D is to simulate the act of including some values, while excluding others and finding an optimal result based on that type of choice. So if the problem is not implicitly asking you to make choices in this inclusion/exclusive way, then we may seriously question if 2D array is necessary. The other major hint about 1D-2D differences is how many inputs have changes required to achieve a subproblem answer? If it's 1, then 1D is natural. if it's 2 then 2D is natural.\n",
    "1. Base-Case return values in recursive solution, will be the the initialization values in a Tabulation approach.\n",
    "    - Solve for each changing variable relative to 0 to find return value\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "\n",
    "        # if f(n-1)\n",
    "        n - 1 = 0 # solve for n\n",
    "        n = 1 # base-case\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - Plug `n = 1` back into `f(n-1)` = `f(0)` = base-case function signature.\n",
    "2. Table dimensions depend on # of changing variables in RR.\n",
    "    - `T(n, m) = T(n-1, m) or T(n, m-1)` = 2 changing vars = 2D table.\n",
    "3. Table cell assignments will be a function of previous table cell values.\n",
    "    - ```python\n",
    "        table[i][j] = table[i][j+1] or table[i-1][j]\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "4. If the function has 3 changing variables, typically there will be 3 or 4 ways to assign a Table cell value\n",
    "    - ```python\n",
    "        table[i][j] = table[i][j-1] or table[i-1][j] or table[i-1][i-j-1] or table[i-1][j-1]\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "5. Conditional evaluations of the inputs must use the dimension variables defining the table.\n",
    "    - Table dimensions are `i, j`\n",
    "    - Input values are `str_A[i-1]` or `str_C[i+j-1]`\n",
    "    - ```python\n",
    "\n",
    "        if str_A[i-1] == str_C[i+j-1]:\n",
    "            table[i][j] = table[i-1][j] or table[i][j-1]\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "6. When writing table cell assignment conditions: think _\"What question is this cell answering?\"_\n",
    "7. The previous row contains all the best-information we have so far. The reason being that tab.DP is copying Bottom-Up recursion. So, the best answer for the current cell, is dependent on the best answers from the previous cells in the previous row.\n",
    "8. DP and Recursion-based DP is all about asking & answering inclusion/exclusion questions and answers. A table cell's value is the best answer as to whether we should include some value, or exclude some value. If the table cell was defined from the inclusive answer, then that table cell value will often be the first occurence of that value. However, if the table cell value was a duplicate value from some previous table cell, then that means the answer to the table cell was found by excluding the value attached to that table cell.\n",
    "9. To trace-back the values that produce some answer, you have to really understand 8 as it provides the inuition on how to find the sequence of values providing the answer and we must be careful to navigate the inclusion/exclusion parts of that sequence.\n",
    "10. There's 4 main techniques to tabulation\n",
    "    1. 1D look-back:\n",
    "        - This technique is usually attached to very simple problems. 1D typically means there's only 1 changing variable that mutates as we make choices. We save some state about the outcome of those choices at cell `table[i][j]`. The best answer for this cell, must include some observation or information from previous cells, as those previous cells represent the best answer about previous problems of the same question.\n",
    "    2. 1D look-ahead:\n",
    "        - This technique is a bit more complex. Look-ahead techniques leverage how some input value can be spread across a list of indices. Given some input, we make a row that has input-long indices. We'll update those indices from all indices prior to that index. Once we arrive at some index, the value will have all been built from the bottom(first-most answer)-up(up to the current answer/index).\n",
    "            ```python\n",
    "\n",
    "            total_count = 5\n",
    "            table = [0]*total_count\n",
    "\n",
    "            # or\n",
    "\n",
    "            word = 'starwars'\n",
    "            table = ['']*len(word)\n",
    "\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            Because of this, we can implicitly have information in the current cell, about future cells (because we know the input and we know what index to find some i'th character about that input). So often times we make some choice about the relationship between the current cell, previous cells, and their relationship to future cells, and update the future cells with some atomized piece of information that only the current cell can provide the future cell. Once we arrive at the last cell, it will contain a series of updates from all the previous cells atomic answers to some big question.\n",
    "    3. 2D look-back:\n",
    "        - This technique is more complex than 1D because we're extracting information from previous rows. Almost all 2D problems contain inclusion/exclusion questions, after all that's the whole point of these types of questions: making conclusions about best choices given different options. So to be clear, remember that at each cell we need to answer an inclusion question and an exclusion question.\n",
    "        - The answer to the exclusion will always be easiest: We simply look at the prev. row, at the current column. If that value indicates the desired result is possible at value j, then excluding the current i'th value achieves the main objective.\n",
    "        - The answer to the inclusion choice will be trickier sometimes. By choosing to include the i'th value, we must also answer the question \"What would be the answer to prev. subproblem choices prior to including this i'th value?\". This means we need to look back in the table to some prev. j, and some prev. i. Often time's it's as simple as `table[i-1][j-1]` or sometimes `table[i-1][j - arr[i]]`. That cell, if it contains some Truthy answer, means we CAN rely upon those previous choices at those previous cells to be concatenated to our current cell's choices to achieve the desired answer.\n",
    "    4. 2D look-ahead:\n",
    "        - I honestly haven't seen this technique employed yet.\n",
    "11. Cell Assignment\n",
    "    1. _Inc/Exc paradigm_ is the key idea at every cell assignment. The current cell must answer 2 questions\n",
    "        - _\"What is the best value to assign `table[i][j]` if we **include** the i'th item with a j sized sub-problem?\"_\n",
    "            * The solution must be: current value + _previous best answer_.\n",
    "            * _Prev best answer_ will be taken from the prev.row & same col. or prev.row & prev.col. or prev.row and j - current-val columns back.\n",
    "                * _j - current-val columns back_ : Represents the remaining subproblem size if we use the current i'th value to solve part of the current subproblem. So that solution + the solution to the remaining subproblem size (which we must have solved already) is the best answer we can achieve.\n",
    "            * Current Answer + Previous Best Answer = Current Cell value of sub-problem size `j`\n",
    "                ```python\n",
    "                    table[i][j] = (\n",
    "                        table[i-1][j-1] + 1 or                      # 1\n",
    "                        table[i-1][j-arr[i]] + 1 or                 # 2\n",

It all boils down to the simple idea that at the i'th row, i'll determine if including this value/item is better than excluding this value/item and keep that result: optimality question & answer.  Of course we can't answer the optimality question unless we also include previous information with the current information. The previous row, will contain all optimal answers we've built up so far, so that's as far as we need to look (1 row up) and depending on the problem either 1 or n rows back. This is the basis of Bottom-Up problem solving, and it's easy to see the Intuition once you can put the dynamics into words. So in summary we can define QT in the following terms.\n",

This is true of most of these type of tab.DP questions with TT behavior. It's important to note that there *Never* exists a subproblem that have overlapping triangular boundries. That would literally mean that we're allowing some overlap between the two sub-sections to exist and we don't want that. The triangular pattern is simply an abstraction sitting atop the idea of a subsection size, but that top of that +90 degree shifted triangle represents the optimality value for that subsection size."
