    "1. Both of the above solutions work but the recursive solution is rather slow.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Recursive Thinking\n",
    "1. For Recursive-Memoized-DP (REMO DP) the idea is to think that you are a _time traveller_ trying to travel to a distant moment in the past when the inputs are exactly equal to 0. If the moment in time has an input value < 0 then you've gone too far and you need to stop looking. If the input is > 0 then you still need to keep looking further into the past.\n",
    "2. Now we create an _expression_ to define the terms from the current present moment, and try to imagine what must the expression say to travel back in time? Well in most DP questions, we're trying to understand the consequences of our choices. And choices can be most aptly compared to a _decision tree_. This decision tree has branches, and each branch represents a move further into the past by making that branch's choice.\n",
    "3. For this problem, we're wanting to travel back in time to a point where we first started to choose to rob a house. So we imagine a moment when we were looking down a neighbood street seeing a long street with lots of houses, and we decided to start robbing. Our choices at that point are to either choose the first house or not. If we choose the first house `index-2 ... + values[index]`, we must add the value of that robbery to our counter.  Then we need to move to the house two houses away, skipping the neighbor.  But what if we chose NOT to rob the first house? Well in that case, we only skip that one house, and we go to the neighbor of the house we just skipped! `index - 1` and re-evaluate the situation.\n",
    "4. That's it!! That's our entire requirement for travelling back in time and seeing the whole tree of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key** is to formulate the recursive calls from the _present_ looking into the _past_ and understanding the conditions at `t=0` moving toward `t=N`."

    "### Solution Thinking\n",
    "1. Just as in the last problem we're going to think recursively from the _present_ moment into the _past_ and try to imagine: _What are the set of choices that I can make at `t=0` to `t=n`?_\n",
    "2. It seems there are 2 sets of choices.\n",
    "    1. We can color the first two posts the same color: This would fall into the first constraint - _only two posts can be painted with the same color_\n",
    "    2. We can NOT color the first two posts the same color: This would fall into the second constraint - _every post must be painted with one color_.\n",
    "    3. **NOTE** It should be noticed that we don't need the problem to explicitly define the choices. Rather we can extract an implied set of choices given a single constraint. Choice 1 is the choice that falls into that constraint. Choice 2 is the choice that allows us to _avoid_ that constraint.\n",
    "3. Now that we have our choices, we must figure out how to express the `state` of remaining choices. In the **Rober** question we defined the expression of the change in state as `index - 1` or `index - 2 + robbed_value`.  In that case, we were saying that the relationship between the two choices was a simple removal of that choice from the choice pool.\n",
    "4. It's also important to note that some moments in time have no relation to previous choices made as in the case of the robber problem. The history of choices the robber made, were not needed to be remembered by the robber to make a choice in the present moment. _This is not always the case_. This problem does require the time traveller to remember his previous choices, but only to a certain extent. For this problem let's refer to our time traveller as \"the painter\". The piainter is time travelling on a timeline that we'll describe as `t=n` to `t=0`. In ther robber problem, when the robber was at `t=n-1`, he didn't need to remember the choice he made previously at `t=n`. However, in this problem it's different.\n",
    "5. The first thing to remember is how the choice pool changes when the painter wants to paint two posts the same color. The problem states that the painter cannot choose more than two colors in a row. This means, if we're at `t=n-1` we need to remember the choice made at `t=n` so that we know what choices are available at `t=n-1`. Also, if the painter does choose two posts of the same color, then chooses a new color of the 2 remaining choices available, his available choices of color reset at `t=n-3`! He can paint the fourth post any of the three colors available since the last two posts are different colors. This means that `t=n-2` needs to know about `t=n-1` choice. Ok, now moving forward one more step, at `t=n-2` into `t=n-3` the choices are exactly the same when the painter was at `t=n`. Now that the painter has found a repetition of choice options across three time units (`t=n`, `t=n-1` and `t=n-2`) he knows how many previous choices he has to remember: 3. The painter is now ready to summarize that pattern into a formula in order to properly travel back in time.\n",
    "6. Let's summarize this first part with two posts the same color - starting out our choices are: `k=3` and `n=5`\n",
    "    - When the painter is at `t=n` he can make `k` choices (three color choices).\n",
    "    - When the painter is at `t=n-1` he can make `k-1` choices (only two colors).\n",
    "    - When the painter is at `t=n-2` his choice of color resets and he has `k` choices again.\n",
    "7. The second and more easy part is if the painter chooses a different color each post. In this case, then at `t=n` the painter has `k` choices. At `t=n-1` he has `k-1` choices since he cannot paint the current post the same color as the previous post choice at `t=n`. Again, at `t=n-2` his choices of color is `k-1` since he still can't paint the current post the same color as before.\n",
    "8. Let's summarize this second part with two posts different colors - start out our choices are: `k=3` and `n=5`\n",
    "    - When the painter is at `t=n` he can make `k` choices (three color choices).\n",
    "    - When the painter is at `t=n-1` he can make `k-1` choices (only two colors).\n",
    "    - When the painter is at `t=n-2` he can make `k-1` choices (only two colors).\n",
    "9. Now we have to combine the first and second part together to express the formula of all choices for both types of scenarios.\n",
    "    1. When the painter is at `t=n` he can:\n",
    "        * Choose `k` colors if he's planning to paint two posts the SAME color.\n",
    "        * Choose `k` colors if he's planning to paint every post a DIFFERENT color.\n",
    "    2. When the painter is at `t=n-1` he can:\n",
    "        * Choose `k` colors if he's planning to paint two posts the SAME color\n",
    "        * Choose `k-1` colors if he's planning to paint every post a DIFFERENT color.\n",
    "    3. When the painter is at `t=n-2` he can:\n",
    "        * Choose `k-1` colors if he's planning to paint two posts the SAME color.\n",
    "        * Choose `k-1` colors if he's planning to paint every post a DIFFERENT color.\n",
    "    4. When the painter is at `t=n-3` he can:\n",
    "        * Choose `k` colors if he's planning to paint two posts the SAME color.\n",
    "        * Choose `k-1` colors if he's planning to paint every post a DIFFERENT color.\n",
    "        * We inclue this 4'th time step `t=n-3` as clear way of showing the that the pattern is now repeating the same flow from step #2. Because of this repeat, we don't need to express this step 4 in our forumla.\n",
    "10. The Formula\n",
    "    * time unit: (same + different) * (choices to remember)\n",
    "    * `t=n`: `(0 + k)` = `(3 + 3)` = `6` -> nothing to remember\n",
    "    * `t=n-1`: `(k + k-1)` = `(3 + 2) * 6` = `30`\n",
    "    * `t=n-2`: `(k-1 + k-1)`\n",
    "    * Final Formula = `(2 + k-1) * (k + k-1)  * (k + k)`\n",
    "    * Final Answer when `k=3`: `(3 + 3) * (3 + 2) * (3 + 3)` = `6 * 5 * 6` = `180`"
