    "# Find-Union | Disjoint Set Union | \"DSU\"\n",
    "\n",
    "is defined as a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find**: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.\n",
    "2. **Union**: Join two subsets into a single subset. Here first we have to check if the two subsets belong to same set. If no, then we cannot perform union.\n",
    "3. A DSU will have an operation to combine any two sets. It will be able to tell in which set a sepcific element element exists. It can create a set from a new element.\n",
    "4. The DSU operations are all (on average) constant time operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can be abstractly mapped to mathematical sets. A set is a collection of elements all belonging to one unit. In discrete mathematics we perform logical operations on such data structures. A logical AND operation is finding the intersection of two sets. An OR operation is finding the union of two sets. So again, mapping this back to graphs, a connected component is a mathematical set. When we want to count the number of connected components, we're also saying we'd like to count the number of unique sets in collection of disjoint (un connected) sets.\n",
    "Some useful problems that can be solved using a DSU are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Detect a Cycle in a graph\n",
    "2. Count # of connected components.\n",
    "3. Compress Jumps on a Path\n",
    "4. Paint subarray offline | Determine max events we can attend given schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `make_set(v)`: Creates a new set with new element `v`.\n",
    "2. `find_set(v)`: Finds the set that `v` belongs to.\n",
    "3. `union_sets(a, b)`: Combines sets `a` and `b`.\n",
    "   1. Union by _Rank_ = **Size**\n",
    "   2. Union by _Rank_ = **Depth**\n",
    "4. Distance from Child up to Parent\n"

    "\n",
    "1. The non DSU solution is well known: We simply perform BFS/DFS and compare the result of each components individual run-size. Using a DSU, we call `union_sets` whenever we locate a cell/value that we want to combine with. By the end of the entire graph traversal, our `sizes` or `depths` list will have all connected components. We would simply return the `max/min` value from this array.\n",
    "2. We can use the same technique in the counting the number of components. We simply update the `.count_islands()` method to keep a globalized max of the size that if finds before reseting the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Compress Jumps along a Segment/Path**\n",
    "\n",
    "One common application of the DSU is the following: There is a set of vertices, and each vertex has an outgoing edge to another vertex. With DSU you can find the end point, to which we get after following all edges from a given starting point, in almost constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of this application is the problem of painting subarrays. We have a segment of length , each element initially has the color 0. We have to repaint the subarray with the color for each query . At the end we want to find the final color of each cell. We assume that we know all the queries in advance, i.e. the task is offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the solution we can make a DSU, which for **each cell stores a link to the next unpainted cell**. Thus initially each cell points to itself. After painting one requested repaint of a segment, all cells from that segment will point to **the cell after the segment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to solve this problem, we consider the queries in the reverse order: from last to first. This way when we execute a query, we only have to paint exactly the unpainted cells in the subarray . All other cells already contain their final color. To quickly iterate over all unpainted cells, we use the DSU. We find the left-most unpainted cell inside of a segment, repaint it, and with the pointer we move to the next empty cell to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can use the DSU with path compression, but we cannot use union by rank / size (because it is important who becomes the leader after the merge). Therefore the complexity will be per union (which is also quite fast).\n",

    "A typical Union-Find will abstract the union of sets to it's own function. In this problem however, we simplified the union on **line 14**. By changing the parents array for the current index to the next index, we're effectively making a union of index `p` and index `p + 1` sets. It's simplified because we're only focused on creating a chain of events. We don't need to 1) Worry about how many events (how many sets), and 2) We don't need to worry about how deep a set can become (how many nodes in a set). Ideas 1 & 2 are typically concerns that are addressed and accounted for in a typical _DSU.union_ method. In this problem we only care about the items NOT in a set, which is the same as saying: _The next available day we can schedule an event._\n",
    "\n",
    "The _find()_ function in the above solution however does map exactly to a typical _DSU.find_ method. It also leverages the _compression_ step: `p[v] = find(p, p[v])`. This step is what flattens out the set's child nodes from being unecessarily ancestralized. Instead, with compression the relationship from parent to child is as shallow as possible. This makes the lookup time extremely fast ~O(1) lookup time, rather than ~O(log(n)).\n"
