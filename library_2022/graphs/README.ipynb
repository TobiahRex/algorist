The reasons for this would be that we're perhaps working with a dense graph, or we want to be able to quickly check if an edge exists between two nodes. We can use a 2D array to store the edges, where the row is the source node and the column is the destination node. This data structure is also useful for matrix multiplication, which we'll see later, and finally geographical type problems where we want some type of topology between nodes; nodes being some object (like land, or a city) and edges being some type of relationship between them (like distance, or a road, water, etc).\n",
