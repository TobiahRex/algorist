# Merge K Sorted Linked Lists
Given k linked lists where each one is sorted in the ascending order, merge all of them into a single sorted linked list.

Example
```
{
    "lists": [
        [1, 3, 5],
        [3, 4],
        [7]
    ]
}
```
Output:
```
[1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7]
```
## Notes
## Constraints:
- 0 <= k <= 104
- 0 <= length of any given linked list <= 103
- -109 <= node values <= 109
- Sum of the lengths of all given lists won't exceed 105.
