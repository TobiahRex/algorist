Here are some example problems related to prime numbers that candidates may encounter in backend engineering interviews:

**1. Prime Factorization:**
   - **Problem:** Write a function to find the prime factorization of a given integer `n`.
   - **Example:** For `n = 56`, the prime factorization is `2^3 * 7`.
   * We looked at this problem in the **_gcd/README.md_** file.

**2. Primality Testing:**
   - **Problem:** Implement a function to determine whether a given integer `n` is prime or not.
   - **Example:** Is `29` a prime number? (Answer: Yes)
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False  # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime

    if n <= 3:
        return True  # 2 and 3 are prime

    # Check if n is divisible by 2 or 3
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False

    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6

    return True

    # Example usage:
    print(is_prime(29))  # Output: True (29 is prime)
    print(is_prime(30))  # Output: False (30 is not prime)
```

**3. Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
   - **Problem:** Write a Python program to find all prime numbers up to a given limit `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
   - **Example:** Find all prime numbers up to `30`. (Answer: `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]`)

**4. Largest Prime Factor:**
   - **Problem:** Find the largest prime factor of a given integer `n`.
   - **Example:** For `n = 13195`, the largest prime factor is `29`.
   ```python
    def largest_prime_factor(n):
        # Initialize the largest prime factor to -1
        max_prime = -1

        # Check if n is divisible by 2 and divide it until it's odd
        while n % 2 == 0:
            max_prime = 2
            n //= 2

        # Check for prime factors starting from 3
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            while n % i == 0:
                max_prime = i
                n //= i

        # If n is still greater than 1, it's a prime factor itself
        if n > 1:
            max_prime = n

        return max_prime

    # Example usage:
    n = 13195
    result = largest_prime_factor(n)
    print("Largest Prime Factor of", n, "is:", result)  # Output: Largest Prime Factor of 13195 is: 29
   ```

**5. Euler's Totient Function:**
   - **Problem:** Implement Euler's Totient Function (φ) that calculates the count of numbers less than or equal to `n` that are coprime with `n`.
   - **Example:** For `n = 10`, φ(10) = 4 because there are 4 numbers (1, 3, 7, and 9) coprime with 10.
   - code: 
```python
def euler_totient_function(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1  # φ(1) = 1 (by definition)

    phi = n  # Initialize phi to n

    # Check for all prime factors of n
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        n_is_divisible_by_p = n % p == 0
        if n_is_divisible_by_p:
            while n % p == 0: # Divide n by p until it's not divisible by p
                n //= p
            phi -= phi // p
        p += 1

    # If n is still greater than 1, it means n is prime
    if n > 1:
        phi -= phi // n

    return phi

    # Example usage:
    n = 10
    result = euler_totient_function(n)
    print("Euler's Totient Function φ(", n, ") =", result)  # Output: Euler's Totient Function φ( 10 ) = 4
```
**Note:** The Euler's Totient Function is also known as Euler's Phi Function. The most confusing part for checking all prime factors, is that we're essentially deleting all multiples of `p` from `n` and then subtracting the count of multiples of `p` from `phi`. This is because multiples of `p` are not coprime with `n`. For example, if `n = 10` and `p = 2`, then `n` is divisible by `2` and `4`, which are not coprime with `n`. So, we delete them from `n` and subtract them from `phi`.

**6. Prime Number Theorem:**
   - **Problem:** Discuss and explain the Prime Number Theorem, which describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers.
   - **Example:** Explain how the theorem states that the density of prime numbers decreases as you move to larger numbers.
   

**7. Goldbach's Conjecture:**
   - **Problem:** Discuss Goldbach's Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
   - **Example:** Can you provide examples of even numbers that satisfy Goldbach's Conjecture?

**8. Mersenne Primes:**
   - **Problem:** Explain what Mersenne primes are and how they are defined. Provide examples of Mersenne primes.
   - **Example:** The prime number `7` is associated with the Mersenne prime `2^3 - 1 = 7`.

These prime-number related problems require a strong understanding of number theory and efficient algorithms for working with prime numbers. They are often encountered in cryptography, number theory, and algorithm design, making them relevant for backend engineering roles in fields like DeFi and blockchain applications.
