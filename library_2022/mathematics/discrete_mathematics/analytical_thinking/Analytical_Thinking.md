## 5. Analytical Thinking
- Definition: Analytical thinking involves breaking down complex problems into smaller components, understanding their relationships, and making informed decisions.
- Example: When debugging a complex software issue, analytical thinking is essential. You examine the code, identify potential sources of errors, analyze logs, and trace the flow of data to pinpoint and fix the problem.
