## 3. Recursive Thinking
- Definition: Recursive thinking involves solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar subproblems.
- Example: In software development, recursion is commonly used when working with data structures like trees or linked lists. You might implement a recursive algorithm to traverse a binary tree, processing each node by applying the same algorithm to its children.
